**PROJECT 1: MLP**

This PyTorch project essentially involved constructing a MLP consisting of multiple non-linear ReLU stages followed by an output using the Softmax logic function with the model being trained on varied generated datasets.

 **PROJECT 2: Computer Vision**

This computer vision project (using PyTorch) took an image as an input and carried out edge and corner detection followed by keypoint detection with SIFT being used to identify the dominant orientation of each keypoint.
